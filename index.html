            Hi, I’m Mishelle Awuor Odhiambo from Kisumu, Kenya. I’m currently taking WDD130 to learn web development,
            with a focus on crafting interactive and creative websites. I enjoy diving into coding challenges—especially
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and I’m passionate about creating user-friendly designs. Outside of coding, I love
            reading and connecting with people, which fuels my creativity and communication skills. I’m eager to build a
            portfolio of polished projects—complete with live demos, responsive layouts, and case-study write-ups—to
            showcase my growth in software development and web design.

        <p>Kenya is a vibrant country in East Africa known for its diverse landscapes, rich wildlife, and cultural heritage. From the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kenya to the sweeping savannahs of the Maasai Mara, it offers breathtaking natural beauty. Kenya is world-famous for its safari experiences, where visitors can witness the Big Five in their natural habitat. Beyond its wildlife, Kenya is home to over 40 ethnic groups, each with unique traditions, languages, and customs, making it a culturally dynamic nation. Nairobi, the capital, blends modern urban life with easy access to nature and national parks.</p>
